# Frontend Mentor - FAQ accordion card

![Design preview for the FAQ accordion card coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

The project was the first attempts to learn programming languages and gain first experience in HTML, CSS and JavaScript

## The challenge

My challenge was to build out this FAQ accordion card and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked
- **Bonus**: Complete the challenge without using JavaScript

Any suggestions on how I can improve are welcome!

## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- JS

### What I learned

First steps in HTML and CSS - solutions compiled from various tutorials that helped me understand the structure, work in VSC, use the program, write the code structure correctly. The use of JavaScript to perform actions aimed at allowing the user to properly operate and view the page element. <br>

Learning to use GitHub, uploading code on GitHub to the repository. <br>

I'm glad you can be here :)

### Continued development

In order to learn more about how to write correct code, I have read a book called: <br>
ðŸ‘‰ "HTML and CSS. Design and Build a Website. Front-End Developer's Handbook" by Jon Duckett, <br>
ðŸ‘‰ Pluralsight Course: Front-End Web Development Quick Start With HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript by Shawn Wildermuth, <br>
ðŸ‘‰ Pluralsight Course: JavaScript: Getting Started- Mark Zamoyta <br>
ðŸ‘‰ Youtube- JS, HTML, CSS (CSS Tutorial â€“ Full Course for Beginners- freeCodeCamp.org) <br>
ðŸ‘‰ W3 Schools--> JavaScript Documentation

Next step: <br>
ðŸ‘‰ Eduweb: Vue and React Course <br>
